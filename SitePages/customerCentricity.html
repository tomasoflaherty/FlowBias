		<h2>Benifits</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Customer experience is fast becoming the differentiator for wining in the marketplace and in fact being able to charge higher prices whilst gaining market share.
		</p>
		<p>
			In todays digital world your brand is only as good as its last couple of reviews. 
			If customers are not happy there is a huge community to tell them where they will be happy.  
			If they are not happy they will not refer you to new potential customers and the word on the street about your brand will not be good.  
			In todays world brand loyalty is fickle. So in short being customer centric keeps and gains customers.

			If your organisation is customer centric then you are easy to do business and, due to your investment in understanding your customers, you have insights that your customers will find valuable.  
			OOTB Product Features and Price, while important, are loosing ground in the influence on customer acquisition and retention.  
			Always remember, according to a 2014 Harvard Business Review marketing paper "acquiring a new customer is anywhere from five to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one", so a customer retention strategy is key to success and survival.

		<h2>Customer Wants and Needs</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Customers want answers and solutions fast.  Customers today are digitally savvy, they understand that consistency of good experience can be baked in to all products, solutions and services.  
			What they don’t want is to know your organisational structure nor how they need to work through it to get what they need.  
			Todays customer wants to believe they are valued as a real person and not a ticket/incident/request number to be passed between various unconnected parts of an organisational structure.
		</p>

		<p>
			Customer centricity means putting customers at the centre, but which customer is that in todays complex solutions driven world.  
			Is it the customer of your customers customer or is it your immediate customer.  In general the answer is all customers in the customer chain but like all things in life, it will depend on your context.  
			Being customer centric means understanding your customers so that you can anticipate their wants and needs and create truly great experiences for them that keep them wanting what you offer.

		<h2>Mindset</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			It is a mindset that needs to be reinforced via corporate level investment if it is to truly be part of the organisational culture so that people feel empowered to make decisions that benefit the customer and the organisation in parallel.  
			Sounds familiar, right?  Well just like a Lean, Agile and DevOps mindset and culture, it is easy to say and even understand but difficult to get right and get engrained.  
			It takes work (planning, training, nurturing, measuring and rewarding) but when it’s built into the Way of Working it quickly makes it way into the Way of Thinking.

		<h2>Achieving Customer Centricity</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Want it</b> - it’s not just a fad of the moment.  It will cost and take time to become a customer centric (or as others say a customer obsessed) organisation
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Own it</b> - Decide who is accountable for it.  Accountability should be at C level
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Embrace it</b> - Executive Leadership and senior management need to lead by example
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Enable it</b> - Plan it, Do(Train, Coach, Mentor and Execute) it, Check it, Adjust it (PDCA Cycle).  Also Hire for it.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Measure it</b> - Ensure Metrics (OKR's, KPI's, Goals...) at all levels reflect the culture you want expressed
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Measuring Customer Centricity</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			How do you know if you are truly executing in a manner that puts the customer at the centre of everything.  
			One effective way is to survey your execs and compare results to the same survey given to your customers.  
			The wider the gap the more potential for improvement.
			Other measures are:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Churn Rate</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Net Promoter Score</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Customer Lifetime Value</b>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>In Your Framework</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			The following are some, but definitely not all, of the touch points where you build a customer centric approach into your Way of Working (WoW) and Way of Thinking (WoT):
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Demo's</b> - Whereever possible, when your customer is willing, 'show and tell' them about the value you are producing
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Retro's</b> - Your customer will have great insights when engaged at the right level
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Backlog Definition</b> - Use approaches such as Customer Journey Mapping and invite your customers
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Planning</b> - When deciding on what Features and Capabilities will be delivered, ask your customer for their insight
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>End Use</b> - How is the value that was delivered actually percieved and consumed by the end users
				</li>
			</ul>
