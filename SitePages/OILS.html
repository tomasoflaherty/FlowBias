		<h2>Intentional Learning</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Intentional learning is the practice of <b>treating every experience as an opportunity to learn something</b>.  
			So instead of learning being something off to the side that happens at pre-prescribed times, it is encouraged to be an output of every event, interaction and deliverable.  
			In effect every daily experience carries with it the opportunity to learn and grow
		</p>
    </div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2>Mindset</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			It is generally accepted that the mindset most associated with intentional learners is one of curiosity and growth. 
			A mindset that truly understands that no question is irrelevant.  
		</p>
		<p>
			It is our view that this mindset can be encouraged and enhanced by putting in place the right organisational structure in tandem with those that develop naturally.
		</p>

		<h2>Benefits</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			There are benefits for both the individual and the organisation when the organisation actively supports intentional learning over incidental.
			<ul>
				<li>
					The individual gets to keep abreast of trends and make connections between personal and professional activities and tools which not only helps them learn and grow but also makes them more attractive, employable and sought after.  
					If we are indeed in for another industrial revolution, these people will lead it
				</li>
				<li>
					The organisation gets a network of people with diverse skills that can not only enhance what they currently offer but also create that next offering that will differentiate them in the market place
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Measuring</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Qualitative measures may include
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							Do people see everyday events as learning opportunities (select a few obvious and less obvious events)
						</li>
						<li>
							Does the team/program/organisation encourage questions from everyone on everything
						</li>
						<li>
							Do employees view learning positively
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Quantitative measures may include
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							Does the organisation encourage retrospectives and at which levels (team, project/product, solution/program…)
						</li>

						</li>
						<li>

		<h2>In Your Framework</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Many opportunities exist within the framework due to fact that the base components of the framework are Lean and Agile Principles.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Reviews</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Demos</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Retrospectives</b>
