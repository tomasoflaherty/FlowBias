		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Feb, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Not another varient of DevOps that means well, DevOps?  Well, in a way, your right.  This is not another varient of DevOps.  What it is, is a recognition that the word DevOps did not encompass everything DevOps stood for.
			Shifting everything left, BizOps, DevSecOps, e.t.c in the spirit of Lean-Agile where everything from ideation right through to customer value realisation, or as some like to more crudely call it 'Concept to Cach' has always been a tennant of DevOps.
			If you understand this then you understand that Business, Security, Compliance, Test, Operations, Development e.t.c are all part of a properly functioning DevOps ecosystem.

			As with many good advancements, the name associated to it can be as much of a protaganist as any detractor.  DevOps appears to be suffering a bit of this with the "its just for dev and ops" view.  
			Does that mean BizOps is just for Business and Operations?  The manifesto will say no.
			This is why we like the term <strike>Dev</strike>XOps because X can be anything.

			<i>Note:  The strike through the Dev reflects that it also represents configurations where Dev is not explicitly mentioned like BizOps

		<h2>People, Processes, Principles, Practices and of course Technology</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Feb, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Many people focus on People, Process and Tools (or Technology) when describing how the Way of Work is or how it should be.  
			But this is not powerful enough to describe a knowledge worker ecosystem.  The fundemental flaw is the missing Way of Thinking.
			What are the principles that drive excelence and outcomes?  Why do we practice what we practice.  This is the mindset needed to achieve Kaizen in the digital world.
			Organisation that encourage experimentation to arrive at the right Way of Working and strive for a learning culture which promotes evolution in the Way of Thinking quickly begin to exibit capabilities synonomus with DevOps.

		<h2>Capabilities</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Feb, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			The capabilities associated with a high performing DevOps organisation are well documented and continually evolving.  
			Litrature such as the book Accelorate and the DORA Program gathers and articulates these capabilities in a manner that that is difficult to improve on, however we will touch on them to varying degrees in this post.
			We will however display a grouping of these capabilities into 3 domains by Scott Prugh from CSG who many of you will recognise the name from litriture like the DevOps handbook and from his many presentations at DOES.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>People & Culture</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Work Process & Measurement</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Technical Practices</b>
