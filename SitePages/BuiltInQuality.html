		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Feb, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Build in quality is the second principle of lean software development as defined by Mary and Tom Poppendieck in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505858328&sr=8-1&keywords=Implementing+Lean+Software+Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implementing Lean Software Development</a>.  
			Many frameworks call it out, as we do here, due to the fact that many orgs don’t fully get its importance without placing it front and centre. The full list of these principles are
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Eliminate Waste</b> (Muda, Mura & Muri)
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Build Quality In</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Create Knowledge</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Defer Commitment</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Deliver Fast</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Respect People</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Optimise The Whole</b>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is also a important tenant of some agile methodologies like Scrum, which we love, and XP, which embodies many of the DevOps technical practices.  
			You might be forgiven for thinking this “Build in Quality” principle refers to shifting QA left, because, well that does build quality in earlier, but it’s so much more.  
			It includes the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Behaviour Driven (BDD), Test Driven (TDD) & Acceptance Test Driven (ATDD) Development</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Pair Programming</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Codified rules in the tools</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Automatic reviews</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Fast Feedback Loops</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Automate</b> all that can be
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Frequently Integrate and Merge</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Cross Functional Team (CFT)</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Refactoring</b>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Built in quality means striving to achieve a state whereby each major area/group that contributes to the end product/solution/outcome minimises, hopefully eliminates, defects being passed to the next station in the journey.
			In Toyota, 'The' leader in Lean manufacturing, continuous improvement of quality practices and constant consistent investigation of all issues is built into the way of working and this is something all organisations can and should learn from.

			Quality is built into the framework and the way of working primarily by but not limited to the following

					<b>Backlog Elaboration</b>
				</li>
				<li>

				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Definitions of Done</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Demos</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Continuous Everything</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Utilising Standards</b>

		<h2>Measuring Quality</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Feb, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			The primary measure of quality is the perception of the customer and their end customers.  
			However as a proxy to that, or in addition, defect numbers coming from test, if applicable, and production give a good indication of quality.  
			Another indicator, and possibly more important to focus on as it’s a leading one, is how often Features or Stories were accepted/rejected during the various demo's.
