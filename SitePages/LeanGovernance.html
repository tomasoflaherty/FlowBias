			Much of what is being moved towards today in a "IT" business, and increasingly "all" business setting has at its foundation Lean thinking and Lean Management.  Agile has at its core Lean.  
			DevOps is an evolution or a realignment with Lean-Agile ways.  The following are the real pioneers who led the way on this and whose work is still valid and cutting edge today:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Peter F. Drucker</b> - The father of Modern Management.  Born and Educuated in Austria, he adopted the US in his late twenties where he lived and worked for most of his adult life
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Taiichi Ohno</b> - The father of the Toyota Production System which inspired Lean Manufacturing. Born in China, educuated in Japan, he joined Toyota in his 30's and rose through the ranks from floor supervisor to executive
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>William Edwards Demming</b> - The leading management thinker in the field of quality.  Born and educated in the United States he was requested by General Douglas MacArthur to help in the effort to assist in Japan.
					The Japaneese quickly recognised the wisdom of his work and words and place considerable weight on them with respect to the Japaneese post world war 2 success at industry due to a focus on quality.
