		<h2>Standard Definition</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			According to Wikipedia “Culture (/ˈkʌltʃər/) is an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Live Science (https://www.livescience.com) defines it as also being "shared patterns of behaviors and interactions, cognitive constructs and understanding that are learned by socialization. 
			Thus, culture can be seen as the growth of a group identity fostered by social patterns unique to the group."
		</p>
		<p>
			Raimon Panikkar identified 29 ways in which cultural change can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, involution, renovation, reconception, reform, innovation, revivalism, revolution, mutation, progress, diffusion, osmosis, borrowing, eclecticism, syncretism, modernization, indigenization, and transformation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Culture is also defined as "a way of thinking, behaving, or working that exists in a place or organization (such as a business)" and it is this context that we must focus more heavily on here.

		<h2>Dev<font size="6px">X</font>Ops Culture</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			The culture of an organisation that embraces DevOps is a mirror of this but with the distinction that all roles and stages that are involved in ensuring the right value is consumed by customers are part of the formulae.  
			Some would say that it’s based on a shared understanding and associated collaboration between development and operations but we believe that is too narrow and in a DevXOps world it’s  all roles and stages that are involved in ensuring the right value is consumed by customers.  
			Another way of looking at it is in terms of Lean and that everything from concept to cash, how to enhance the delivery of it and the experience the customer receives is considered.  
			So in other words Lean applied to Agile achieves what DevOps does.
			In fact there is a growing understanding that a Lean-Agile and a DevOps culture are to the most part more or less the same thing with DevOps highlighting theses extra items that are built into Lean-Agile:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Embracing change</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Embracing failure</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Openness and honesty</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Blameless postmortums</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Tooling and Technology</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rewarding Behaviour</b>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>In Your Framework</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Jan, 2022</h5>

			Bringing roles together and ensuring smooth interaction and information flow is one half of the equation.
			The other half is instilling, supporting and recognising a sense of need for constant improvement and automation to all aspects of organisational life both within delivery and operations but also within less obvious areas like Security & Compliance, Product Management and Finance to name a few.
			This does not mean you have to be cutting edge or perfectly organised but movements towards the following is what is necessary:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Cross functional Agile Teams</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>DevOps teams</b> - yes a loaded term with many taxonomies, hense we think more in terms of DevXOps
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Automation frameworks</b> - Build, Test and Deploy
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Shift left on everything</b> - When deciding on what Features and Capabilities will be delivered, ask your customer for their insight
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Multiple feedback loops</b> - Technical and human
				</li>
			</ul>
