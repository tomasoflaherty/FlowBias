			Documenting requirements is important.  However the degree to which we go and when and how we drive out those requirements is key to being set up for successful delivery.
			<br>For example a set of Use Cases that broadly covers end-to-end delivery with associated Epics and Features whereby the Epic and Feature elaboration depends on where on the roadmap timeline they fit.

		<h2>Model</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, August, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			The requirements model exists primarily to facilitate building the backlog of, primarily, Epics and Features. At its most basic it consists of:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Driving out Business Requirements</b> - Using the best industry standard tools like Customer Journeys
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Creating items that reflect delivery of business outcomes/value</b> - Epics, Features and Stories
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Creating items that allow/encourage conversation and alignment on flow of value with customers</b> - Use Cases
				</li>
			</ul>

			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			Whatever entities you adopt, it is important to use a consistent language with your stakeholders when you are
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Describing Scope</b> - The degree to how much upfront scope and the level it's described at will depend on the maturity of your customers/stakeholders
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Describing delivery of Value</b> - The value that will be delivered in Delivery Cycles
				</li>
			</ul>
			<i>These backlog model items should also lend themselves naturally to describing the working software/(sub)system so that extensibility and maintainability are ensured</i>

		<h2>Measuring and Traceability</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, May, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			The Feature is the item to which all other items should be traced or reflected in.  This can be done in, preferably, a work management tool, in a content management tool, assuming some automation is built in, or in more traditional spreadsheet matrices.
			<br>Upstream 
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>The Customer Journey a Feature belongs to</b> - if using customer journeys as a tool to understand customer needs
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>The Use Case the Feature relates to</b> 	- depending on the level it is written at, use case could equate to feature
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>The Epic the Feature is a child of</b> 	
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>The Capability the Feature is a part of</b> - This is less commonly used as it is effectively a Feature that crosses Delivery units that is committed to in the same Delivery Cycle  
				</li>
			</ul>
			At Feature Level 
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>The Business Value</b> 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>The Acceptance Criteria</b> 	
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>The Feature Functional Level Design Details</b>
				</li>
			</ul>
			Downstream 
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>The Stories that Deliver the Feature</b> 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>The Tests that Verify the Feature</b> 	
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>The Defects that challenge the Feature</b> 	
				</li>
			</ul>			
		</p>
		<p>
			In a customer centric environment, Requirements gathering is really about figuring out, what things does the customer need<br>
			When applying metrics to Requirements, what we are really focused on is the Feature as the vehicle that to drive whether we are gathering and delivering the right things.

		<h2>In Your Framework</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, May, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Define and make use of the entities that make sense.  Remember all organisations need backlogs to get from ideation to end state value but dont assume everything id a backlog items.  Some items are just tools used to create backlog items e.g. Customer Journeys used to understand a customers Business Requirements.
