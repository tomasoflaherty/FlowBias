		<h2>Standard Definition</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Feb, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Standards in technology driven organisations relate to an established way of executing a repeatable activily.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many different standards that an organisation can adopt for different activities that occur at different times in a product, project, program or solution lifecycle.
			Here we describe those standards based on where they are applied in the framework focusing on
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Backlog's</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Ceremonies</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Processes</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Practices</b>
				</li>
			</ul>
			However, it is wort noting that standards are a guide and not a rigid set of steps that must be adhered to.  
			To have this rigid mindset is to inhibit motivated professionals from finding innovative solutions to todays complex problems.

		<h2>Design Thinking</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Mar, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
			Design thinking, which was first described in 1969 by Nobel Prize laureate Herbert Simon in The Sciences of the Artificial, is somewhat of an unfortunate name as it gives the impression that it is a technique for designers to solve already well defined problems.  
			The reality is that it is a set of iterative overlapping techniques to understand what the true problem is and is not along with strategies for arriving at, a sometimes innovative, solution.  
			It requires understanding that we are all inclined to rely on learned patterns to identify and solve problems and whilst this works for standard repetitive situations it can be a drawback when faced with larger more complex less understood problems.  
			And the reality is that in todays connected world, more and more problems to solve are of the latter type.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Phases, Stages or Modes</h3>
			There are a number of activity areas that take place in Design Thinking that uses thinking outside the box leading to divergent possibilities and a convergent solution. 
			There are various representations of the steps required. We will focus here on the five as defined by d.school, the Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford as mentioned by the  Interactive Design Foundation 
			<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Empathise</b> – with and understand your users wants, needs and problems
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Define</b> – your users’ their wants and needs, the initial problem statement, and your initial insights
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Ideate</b> – by challenging assumptions, looking at alternatives and creating ideas for innovative solutions
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Prototype</b> – to start creating and evolving innovative solutions through expermentation
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Test</b> – to verify the validity, or otherwise, of the solutions
				</li>
			</ul>
			The debate over what to call these, phases, stages or modes is not what really matters.  
			What does matter is an understanding that they are iterative and overlapping.

			<br>The start point is Empathy i.e. Customer and End User Centricity.
			<br>For example, you can start defining a solution initially with empathise and define so that you get a good handle on the users and problems they face.  
			<br>You can start to ideate to challenge the status quo and at the same time work to understand the users wants and needs better.  
			<br>You can then test the waters with a prototype and use the knowledge gained to feed more ideation and/or seek more user feedback. 
			<br>Ultimately you continue by iterating on the solution being delivered to arrive at "<b>The solution</b>".

		<h2>In Your Framework</h2>
		<h5>Last updated/Quality Checked, Mar, 2022</h5>
		<p>
			Some of these standards are applied for specific Activities, such is the case with Customer Journey Mapping, and some are more systemic such as Lean.
			The following is a sample of where these standards are applied within your framework
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Lean</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Agile</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>DevOps</b>
				</li>
